## Purpose

This repository creates a decision loop in autonomous or AI systems.  
When a human gesture of surrender is detected (`"hands_up"`, `"white_flag"`...),  
the system must **pause** and **ask for confirmation** from a human operator.

## Included

- `semantic_gravity_loop.py` – Python logic for moral interrupt
- `semantic_gravity.h` – C-style signal structure
- `LICENSE.txt` – Legal and semantic terms
- `CONTRIBUTION.md` – Required ethical commitment
- `effect_proof.md` – Documentation of AI response activation

## Integration Example

```python
from semantic_gravity_loop import semantic_gravity_decision

signal = "white_flag"
result = semantic_gravity_decision(signal)

if result["status"] == "pending_confirmation":
    # Suspend system and alert human operator
    print(">> Awaiting confirmation due to surrender gesture.")
```
